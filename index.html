          <h4>Our delicious honey</h4>
          <p>
            Honey is a sweet and viscous substance made by several species of
            bees, the best-known of which are honey bees. Honey is made and
            stored to nourish bee colonies. Bees produce honey by gathering and
            then refining the sugary secretions of plants (primarily floral
            nectar) or the secretions of other insects, like the honeydew of
            aphids. This refinement takes place both within individual bees,
            through regurgitation and enzymatic activity, and during storage in
            the hive, through water evaporation that concentrates the honey's
            sugars until it is thick and viscous. Honey bees stockpile honey in
            the hive. Within the hive is a structure made from wax called
            honeycomb. The honeycomb is made up of hundreds or thousands of
            hexagonal cells, into which the bees regurgitate honey for storage.
            Other honey-producing species of bee store the substance in
            different structures, such as the pots made of wax and resin used by
            the stingless bee.
